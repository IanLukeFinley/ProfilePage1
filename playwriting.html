            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
            In addition to software development and arts education and management, I have 
            extensive experience as a playwright, in North Carolina and nationally.  I earned
            my MFA in Dramatic Writing from NYU in 2004, where I also won the Harry Kondoleon
            Award in playwriting, along with the Kennedy Center's 2002 Jean Kennedy Smith Award
            for <em>The Nature of the Nautilus</em>.

          <h2>Works</h2>
          <p>
            From 2004 until 2012, I served as Resident Playwright for Burning Coal Theatre Company, a small professional
            theater in Raleigh, NC.  Notable works for Burning Coal include <em>1960</em>, written to celebrate the anniversary of the desegregation of Raleigh schools,
            <em>Jude the Obscure</em>, a two-part adaptation of Thomas Hardy's masterpiece, and <em>The Greeks</em>, an
            adaptaion of Sophocles' Theban Plays.  Other major works include <em>Native</em> for EBZB Productions
            and <em>And There Was War in Heaven</em>, selected as a Finalist in the 2017 O'Neil National Playwright's Conference.
