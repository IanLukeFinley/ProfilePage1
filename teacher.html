            <h2>Research Triangle High School</h2>
            <p>
            I have been a theatre educator for 18 years: eight with Burning Coal Theatre Company, and ten at Research Triangle High School.
            RTHS is a STEM focused school in the RTP, and regularly listed among the top 20 schools in the state.  At RTHS, I founded
            and built the theatre program, which produces four full shows a year, and graduates students who have gone on to Yale, NYU, UNC School 
            of the Arts, and other leading universities.

            <h2>Innovative Instruction</h2>
            <p>
          As a founding faculty member, I was at the front of RTHS' innovative teaching model, which emphasized "Flipped"
          Learning, using video for lecture content, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. My theatre education videos on YouTube
          are used by dozens of different schools, and have ammassed hundreds of thousands of views. </p>
          <p>To support our focus on collaboration, I worked with the Arts Faculty to create the Senior Arts Lab, a one-of-a-kind course for 
            advanced high school art students to work with students in other disciplines, and create challenging new pieces.
